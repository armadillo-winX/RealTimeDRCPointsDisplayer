# Note
I don't know whether the program displays the status correctly so it is better to manually count points then compare it to the program's. If you find it show incorrectly, please tell me so I can fix it :).
By the way, the "Settings" button is not working yet, but it will be included in the next update.

# Live DRC Points Calculator
(formaerly known as RealTimeDRCPointsDisplayer)
An user interface application that displays in-game information and calculates DRC points for you during your run or your replay.

# What's new
Settings button works now, project completed. Yay

# Installing and Recommendation
- You just need to download the folder to whereever you want in your PC. Creating a shortcut on the desktop is recommended.
- It is required to have stable Internet connection to download files when booting the application.

# Mechanism
- Downloading part and loading part for rubric file and world record file are operated first.
- When the application is ready for reading the game's memory, hit "Find Game" button. It will start doing its job and the button will be greyed out until the game is closed.
