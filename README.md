# Note
I don't know whether the program displays the status correctly so it is better to manually count points then compare it to the program's. If you find it show incorrectly, please tell me so I can fix it :).

# RealTimeDRCPointsDisplayer
A console (for now) application that counts DRC points for you during your run or your replay.

# What's new
All Windows maingames, PoFV and GFW are now supported

# Installing and Recommendation
- You just need to download the folder to whereever you want in your PC. Creating a shortcut on the desktop is recommended.
- As this is a console window, the window itself and its texts may be small. When running the application, it is recommended to change the font and the size of the text. Right-click the title of the window and select Properties. Choose the Font tab, change the text size and font to your preference, then hit OK.

# Mechanism
- Downloading part and loading part for rubric file and world record file are operated first.
- The application willl auto-detect any Windows maingame + PoFV and GFW. Once it founds a game, status for that game will be displayed on the console window.
