# Note
I don't know whether the program displays the status correctly so it is better to manually count points then compare it to the program's. If you find it show incorrectly or working improperly, please tell me so I can fix it :).

# Live DRC Points Calculator
(formaerly known as RealTimeDRCPointsDisplayer)
An user interface application that displays in-game information and calculates DRC points for you during your run or your replay.

# What's new
- 1.2: Add warning and MoF scoring formula
- 1.1: Add Settings button
- 1.0: Finish console version, move to GUI version

# Installation and Recommendation
- You just need to download the zip file and extract it wherever you want in your PC. Optionally, you can create a shortcut to the execution on the desktop.
- It is required to have Internet connection to download files when booting the application, otherwise it will read the existing ones.

# Mechanism
- Downloading part and loading part for rubric file and world record file are operated first.
- When the application is ready for reading the game's memory, hit "Find Game" button. It will start doing its job and the button will be greyed out until the game is closed.
